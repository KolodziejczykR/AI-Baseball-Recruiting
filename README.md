# AI/ML Baseball Recruitment App

## Overview
This project is an AI/ML-assisted baseball recruitment platform that helps athletes find the best-fit colleges based on their stats and preferences.

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend (FastAPI)

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

- Make sure you have all required model files in `backend/ml/models/`.
- If you change any backend code, just refresh/restart the server.
- The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Troubleshooting
- If you get a CORS error, make sure the backend includes CORS middleware (already set up in `main.py`).
- If you get a "prediction pipeline not available" error, check that all model files exist in `backend/ml/models/`.

### 2. Start the Frontend (React)

From the `frontend` directory, run:

```bash
npm install   # Only needed the first time
npm start
```

- The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Make sure the backend is running on port 8000 for predictions to work.

### 3. Usage
- Fill out the form with your stats and click **Predict** to get your college projection probabilities.
- You can load an example or clear the form with the provided buttons.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` — FastAPI backend, ML models, and API logic
- `frontend/` — React app for user input and results display

---

## Development Notes
- If you add new models or change the pipeline, make sure to update the model files in `backend/ml/models/`.
- For production, update CORS settings and use a production server (e.g., gunicorn + nginx for backend, Vercel/Netlify for frontend).

For any issues, check the backend terminal for errors and ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Setup Instructions
- See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for component-specific setup.
